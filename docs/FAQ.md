## General Questions

### What is STL Previewer?

STL Previewer is a VS Code extension that lets you view and compare 3D STL (Stereolithography) files directly within the editor. It provides interactive 3D visualization and Git diff capabilities for STL files.

### What file formats are supported?

Currently, STL Previewer supports:

- **STL (Binary format)** - Most common, more compact
- **STL (ASCII format)** - Text-based, human-readable

Both formats are fully supported for viewing and Git diff operations.

### Is it free?

Yes! STL Previewer is completely free and open-source under the MIT license.

### Where can I get it?

- **VS Code Marketplace**: [Install from Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=misiekhardcore.stl-previewer)
- **GitHub**: [Source code](https://github.com/misiekhardcore/stl-previewer)

### Who maintains this extension?

The extension is maintained by [misiekhardcore](https://github.com/misiekhardcore) with contributions from the community.

## Installation & Setup

### How do I install it?

See the [Quick Start Guide](QUICK_START.md#installation) for detailed installation instructions.

### What are the requirements?

- **VS Code**: Version 1.52.0 or higher
- **Git Extension**: Required for diff functionality (usually pre-installed)
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Hardware**: Any system that runs VS Code (GPU acceleration recommended)

### Do I need any other software?

No! Everything needed is included in the extension. You don't need:

- ‚ùå Separate 3D viewer applications
- ‚ùå Additional plugins or libraries
- ‚ùå CAD software to view files

### Can I use it in VS Code Web/Browser?

The extension is designed for desktop VS Code. Browser support may be limited due to WebGL and file system requirements.

## Usage Questions

### How do I open an STL file?

Just click on any `.stl` file in VS Code. It will automatically open in the STL Previewer.

If it opens in a text editor instead:

1. Right-click the file
2. Choose "Open With..."
3. Select "STL Previewer"

### How do I rotate/zoom the view?

**Mouse controls:**

- **Rotate**: Left-click and drag
- **Pan**: Right-click and drag
- **Zoom**: Mouse wheel scroll

**Keyboard:**

- Use preset view buttons for standard angles

### Can I take screenshots?

Yes! Position your view as desired, then:

- **VS Code**: Use external screenshot tools
- **Windows**: Snipping Tool or Win+Shift+S
- **macOS**: Cmd+Shift+4
- **Linux**: Built-in screenshot tools

### How do I measure dimensions?

Enable the info panel to see bounding box dimensions:

```json
{
  "stlPreviewer.showInfo": true,
  "stlPreviewer.showBoundingBox": true
}
```

The info panel shows width, length, and height in the file's original units.

### Can I edit STL files?

No, STL Previewer is a viewer only. For editing, you'll need:

- CAD software (Fusion 360, SolidWorks, FreeCAD, etc.)
- Mesh editors (Blender, MeshLab, etc.)

### Can I export views as images?

Not directly. Use screenshot tools to capture the current view.

### Why don't I see any colors?

STL files don't contain color information - they only store geometry. The extension applies materials for visualization. You can customize colors in settings:

```json
{
  "stlPreviewer.meshMaterialConfig": {
    "color": "#ff6600"
  }
}
```

## Git Diff Questions

### How does Git diff work for STL files?

STL Previewer uses Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) to calculate geometric differences:

1. Loads both versions (old and new)
2. Performs 3D boolean operations
3. Displays results with color coding:
   - üü¢ Green = Added geometry
   - üî¥ Red = Removed geometry
   - üîµ Blue = Unchanged geometry

### What do the colors mean in diff view?

See the [Git Diff section in Usage Guide](USAGE.md#understanding-diff-colors) for detailed color explanations.

### Why is diff view slow?

CSG operations are computationally intensive, especially for complex models with many triangles. This is normal and expected.

**Tips for faster diff:**

- Simplify models in CAD software before committing
- Use lower polygon counts where possible
- Be patient - complex diffs can take 30+ seconds

### Can I compare any two STL files?

The Git diff feature only works with files tracked in Git. To compare arbitrary files:

1. Open both files side-by-side
2. Use the same viewing angle for both
3. Compare visually

### Why doesn't my diff show any changes?

Possible reasons:

- File might not have geometric changes (metadata only)
- Both versions might be identical
- File might not be tracked in Git
- Git extension might not be enabled

Check with:

```bash
git diff --stat yourfile.stl
```

## Performance Questions

### Why is my file loading slowly?

**Common causes:**

- **Large file size**: Files over 50MB take longer
- **Complex geometry**: High polygon count increases load time
- **Multiple features enabled**: Grid, axes, info panel add overhead

**Solutions:**

- Use "basic" material type
- Disable visual helpers (grid, axes, etc.)
- Close other heavy extensions

### How can I improve performance?

See the [Performance Optimization section in Usage Guide](USAGE.md#performance-optimization) for detailed performance tips and configuration examples.

### What's the maximum file size?

There's no hard limit, but:

- **< 10MB**: Fast loading, smooth interaction
- **10-50MB**: Slower loading, good interaction
- **50-100MB**: Slow loading, may lag
- **> 100MB**: Very slow, may fail on some systems

### Why is the viewer laggy?

**Possible causes:**

- Large file size
- Complex material (Standard/Phong)
- Too many visual helpers enabled
- Insufficient system resources
- Outdated graphics drivers

**Try:**

- Switch to "basic" material
- Disable all visual helpers
- Update graphics drivers
- Close other applications

## Questions About the Technology

### What rendering engine does it use?

STL Previewer uses **Three.js** (currently v0.178.0), a popular WebGL-based 3D library.

### How does CSG diff work?

The extension uses **three-bvh-csg** library to perform:

- Boolean subtraction (for added/removed parts)
- Boolean intersection (for common parts)

These operations run in a Web Worker to avoid blocking the UI.

### Is the viewer GPU-accelerated?

Yes! Three.js uses WebGL, which is GPU-accelerated. Performance depends on your graphics card.

### Can I use it offline?

Yes, once installed, the extension works completely offline. No internet connection needed for viewing files.
